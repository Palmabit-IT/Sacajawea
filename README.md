## Manage your multi-language routes with Next.js, easily

Based on [Next-Routes](https://github.com/fridays/next-routes) and [next-routes-with-locale](https://github.com/vonschau/next-routes-with-locale) the main changes are:
* Ability to add routes by forcing the presence of the initial language of the route
* Improved route management
* improved coverage and tests


In the future I will want to implement:
+ handle error with exact status code 
+ static SEO files (robots.txt, google verification file, etc)
